# Nano-Social-Network
This is a Nano Social Network - very small scale simple functionality social network. It is written in PLAIN PHP! <br> 
I have just started creating it on 19 March 2017, so it is way too far from being ready. <br>
The scripts "sign_up.php" and "registration.php" form a sign up system of the network. <br>
The scripts "log_in.php", "entrance.php", and "log_out.php" form a log in/log out system of the network. <br>
The script "home.php" is a starting page of the network. The only one available for not signed up or logged in users. <br>
The script "profile_page.php" is a home page for logged in users. <br>
The script "inventory_view.php" displays all the signed up users except for the user who called it, he is not on a list. In the future it will be used for add friends functionality. <br>
